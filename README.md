# Audio-Blend-Modes

Coming from a design background, I am familiar with the concept of layers and blend modes in image editing programs such as Photoshop/Gimp, ... are familiar to me.
I try to transfer this concept to audio editing, not to create a "new", "fancy" way of audio editing and mixing, but rather a different way of creating sound.
A new, different approach to being creative in audio.
The goal is to write software that works independently or perhaps as a VST plugin.

This application is written in the JUCE framework.

This application is still very early in the development phase and only supports a few functions.

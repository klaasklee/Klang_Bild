# Audio-Blend-Modes

Klang_Bild is a stand-alone software that allows the user to layer and edit audio, similar to a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).
A special feature is that layers can be combined with each other using different blend modes.

Coming from a design background, I am familiar with the concept of layers and blend modes in image editing programs such as Photoshop or Gimp.

My good friend Lennart Hinz and I transfered this concept to audio editing, not to create a “new”, “fancy” way of audio editing and mixing, but rather a different way of creating sound.

A new, different approach to being creative in audio.
What does multiply or a dropshadow sound like?
